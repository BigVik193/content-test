# Content Test Repository

Why did the developer go broke? Because they used up all their cache! 💸

## About This Repo

This is a test repository, but I'm trying to *git* better at making jokes!

## Features

- No context rules (because context is overrated)
- Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs! 🐛

## Installation

To clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bigvik193/content-test.git
```

P.S. What did the Git say to the developer?
Commit-ment issues much? 😉
