# Content Test Repository

Why did the developer go broke? Because they used up all their cache! 💸

## About This Repo

This is a test repository, but I'm trying to *git* better at making jokes!

## Features

- No context rules (because context is overrated, just like my programming jokes)
- Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs! 🐛

## Installation

To clone this repo, just remember:
Why did git reject the mind reader? Because it couldn't read the commit-ments! 🔮

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bigvik193/content-test.git
```

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute! Just remember:
What did the pair programmer say to their partner?
You complete my if-else statement! ❤️

## License

This project is licensed under the "Why did the programmer quit their job?
Because they didn't get arrays!" License 📜
